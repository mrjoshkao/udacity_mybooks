# MyReads Project

This application is written according to this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view). Some notes:

* [`package.json`](package.json) has version numbers updated from the original template. One of the major updates is to 'react-router-dom' which handles routes a little differently than in react 15.5.4
* The search page looks different from the template because it renders the same bookshelf component that the main page does. It contains 2 such components, one to handle search results that match with none of the shelves on the main page and a component to handle the books that do exist on one of shelves of the main page
* If you assign the default books to the 'none' shelf, I have so far not found a way to get them back without going into your dev tools application tab and deleting the token generated for the API calls: this forces the app to generate a new token and when you access the API with that token, the default books are back
* The rest of this README.md is from the original template (source: Udacity)

## TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* if runnig on a local machine, navigate to localhost:3000 to view the result

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
